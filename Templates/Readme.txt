This contains two templates.

1. Raw_data File --> This file has to be necessarily uploaded by the user to run the automation. 
                     This is the row-report file.        Sample file is shown in the Raw_Data.csv.




2. Raw_input File ---> This file needs to be uploaded by the user if he wants to generate output for multiple inputs in a single excel file.
                       The output for each inputs will be stored in seperate sheets. Sample input is shown in Raw_input file.
Note- The columns that are required to group the data should be necessarily present in the raw_input file. Other columns will not affect the output. They may or may not be present.
